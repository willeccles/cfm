.SH NAME
cfm \- cactus file manager

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cfm
.RI [ DIR ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cfm
is a simple, clean, fast TUI file manager.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR DIR
Directory to open
.B cfm
in, or the working directory if not specified.

.SH CONFIGURATION
Copy \fIconfig.def.h\fR to \fIconfig.h\fR and modify as needed to configure at
build-time. By default,
.B cfm
will attempt to read the \fIEDITOR\fR, \fISHELL\fR, and \fIOPENER\fR environment
variables. If it is preferable for
.B cfm
to use a different value for any of these, it can be specified by prepending
\fICFM_\fR to any of the variables.
.B cfm
will also check for the \fICFM_TMP\fR environment variable for a location for its
temp directory. If the variable is not set and \fICFM_TMP\fR was not set in
\fIconfig.h\fR, it will attempt to use \fI/tmp/cfmtmp\fR. If the temporary
directory cannot be created, then
.B cfm
will disable cut/paste and deletions will be permanent (no undo).
